// Per-request context: turn a bearer token into an authenticated caller.
//
// YOURS TO WRITE. This file ships as a stub so the server boots and every
// authenticated request fails loudly instead of appearing to work.
//
// What it has to do (BRIEF.md §3, PERMISSIONS.md §6):
//   - read the bearer token, verify it with verifyAccessToken() from ./auth.js
//   - look the membership up and refuse a token whose org or membership is gone
//   - THE TOKEN'S org CLAIM IS THE ONLY ORG THE CALLER MAY ADDRESS. A request that
//     names a different org is INVISIBLE — 404, never 403. Isolation is structural:
//     the caller cannot name another org, rather than being filtered afterwards.
//   - check freshness against memberships.perm_version (AUTH-DATA-MODEL.md §3), so a
//     role or grant change takes effect on the NEXT request, not at token expiry
//   - throw through the one error path in ./http.js
//
// authenticate(db, secret) returns (req, params) => caller, where caller carries at
// least { userId, orgId, role, membership, claims }.
